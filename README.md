### What is it about?
This app is a mockup-app for a fictive car insurance that collects data about it's customer's driving habits and adapts the individual
insurance plans based on the analyzed data.
The user can choose between a number of so called 'Privacy Modes' such as 'Maximum Data', 'Obfuscation' or even create an own mode based on
his personal needs. Depending on what mode a customer chooses, his plan may rise or lower in price.
The user can also view his driving data and report it if necessary.
